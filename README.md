# object_oriented_scripts
This is a repository with matlab scripts written in an object oriented way.

### Purpose: 

streamline two tasks (finding SST gradients and produce cloud image analysis)
with different measurements from ATOMIC.

### Status:

Ongoing, need to complete ATOMIC_GOES16 and ATOMIC_dataVisual

 - [] do analysis for cross-SST wind component for the disregarded RHB segments
 - [] understand temporal cloud fraction better, do a correlation analysis with the SST.
 - [] add two more instruments: saildrones_noaa (1063 and 1064); svp-s drifters (9, has wind direction).
