# About this github repository
### 1. language and structure


### 2. To-do list:
[] - check cross-SST wind variation and its correlation with the SST
[] - try computing coupling coefficients (or show the bin statistics between delta wind and delta SST)
[] - find correlation between SST and the temporal cloud fraction.


# About this ongoing analysis
## Background
### 1. Air-Sea Interaction at mesoscale and the coupling coefficients


## Methods
### 1. Wavelet coherence
##### - recipes:


##### - a note on the significance level.

##### - ?


### 2. statistical bin analysis? correlation analysis?
