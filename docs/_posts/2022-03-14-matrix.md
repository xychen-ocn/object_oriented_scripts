Similar to Meroni et al. (2020), we can also look at the following matrix pair in our wavelet coherence analysis: (or simply using correlation analysis as they showed.)
 - wind speed and SST (currently)
 - wind convergence $$ \nabla \cdot \vec{u} $$ and SST gradient magnitude
 - wind convergence and the scalar product between wind and SST gradient 
   $$ \vec{u} \cdot \nabla SST $$ (effective SST rate of change felt by the single air parcel during its motion
 - wind convergence and Laplacian of SST ($$ {\nabla}^2SST $$)


## Expected correlations (spatial & temporal)
|matrix pairs  |  spatial correlation  | temporal correlation |
|------------ | -------- | -------- |

|wind speed & SST  |   |   |
| wind div & SST gradient mag |  |   |
|wind div & SST rate of change felt by the single air parcel | | |
|wind div & Laplacian of SST | positive | |


### What type of wind speed to use for the analysis?
I have been using the 10-m neutral wind speed, which is near-surface stability corrected, assuming a logarithmic profile. I thought about perhaps using the uncorrected wind speed at the measurement height will be useful as well. That way, the effect of stability is included as well. With the neutral wind speed, how could we see effect of stability? Perhaps we are seeing more about the other mechanism?


### how about cloudiness? Can I look at the correlations between cloudiness and fluxes?

### Is there any advantages using coherence instead of correlations?
